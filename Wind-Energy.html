    <h2 class="wind_h2">What is Wind energy?</h2>
    <p class="windp">
        Wind Energy is the process of using wind power to generate electricity using a generator.

    <h2 class="wind_h2">How It Works!</h2>
    <p class="windp">
        Wind energy comes from wind turbines or also known as windmills. You might have seen it before on a on a drive. The wind turbines work like a fan. People use fans for cold air the way people use wind turbine for electricity.

    <h2 class="wind_h2">Benefits/Advantages</h2>
    <p class="windp">
        One benefit of wind energy is the fact that it is renewable. Non renewable fuels pollute our environment. Unlike solar energy it does not make sense for average people to set up wind energy in their houses. But when it is used at a large scale, it can
        be more efficent than solar energy. In places where there is not much sunshine and windy conditions, it is perfect conditions for wind energy to be used.
